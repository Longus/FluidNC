## Requirements

This install requires:

- A Serial USB Port (such as the Silicon Labs Driver)
- Python3

For help with these, see https://github.com/Longus/FluidNC/wiki/Set-Up-FluidNC-Using-macOS

## Installing FluidNC on your ESP32

Unpack this FluidNC release Zip file.

Plug your ESP32 into a USB port.

In a Terminal window:
- cd to the directory this 'HOWTO-INSTALL.txt' is located in (type `cd` with a space after, then drag the folder from the 'Finder.app' onto the 'Terminal.app' window)
- run one of the following commands (if you have problems, use the full path to the file):
  - To install the WiFi version:
  `sh install-wifi.sh`
  - To install the Bluetooth version:
  `sh install-bt.sh`
  - To replace the ESP32 local filesystem:
  `sh install-fs.sh`

### Local Filesystem Considerations

Replacing the local filesystem is only useful for the wifi
version, since its default contents are only needed for
running the WebUI user interface over WiFi.

The disadvantage of replacing the local filesystem is that
it will overwrite any files that you might already have
there, such as FluidNC config files, WebUI preferences
and macros.  The advantage is that you will get the latest
version of the index.html.gz file that contains the WebUI
code.  Another way to get a new index.html.gz is to upload
it via WebUI from wifi/index.html.gz herein.

A good approach is to use install-fs only on your first
FluidNC installation, or to start from a clean slate.

### What Can Go Wrong?

Strange failures can be caused by version mismatches between system libraries and
the precompiled esptool executable in the macos directory.

The workaround is to run the Python version of esptool - esptool.py - under Python,
instead of using the esptool executable version.  The Internet has many tutorials
for using esptool.py .  You can find the appropriate command line arguments in the
.sh files.
